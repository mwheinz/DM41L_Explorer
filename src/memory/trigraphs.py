"""
Trigraph encode/decode for the HP41/DM41L character set (docs/trigraphs.md).

FOCAL (the HP41/DM41's character set) is a superset-but-not-quite of ASCII:
most printable characters mean what they'd mean in plain ASCII, but a
handful of byte codes are reassigned to symbols ASCII has no glyph for
(Sigma, an up arrow, a "not equal" sign, and so on) -- including some codes,
like 0x5C/0x5E/0x60/0x7E, that *are* normal ASCII punctuation positions but
mean something else entirely on a real HP41/DM41L display.

Since our plain-text import/export files are 7-bit ASCII (see
ExtendedMemory's ASCII-file records and registers.format_data_line()/
parse_data_line()'s alpha-text branch), any byte that doesn't safely mean
itself in plain ASCII is written out as a "trigraph": a backslash followed
by either a short mnemonic (e.g. "\\T" for the Tee symbol, from
docs/trigraphs.md's table) or, as a general fallback for *any* byte
(including ones that already have a mnemonic), exactly three decimal
digits (e.g. "\\065" for byte 65 / 'A'). The three-decimal-digit form is
always fixed-width -- docs/trigraphs.md's own example ("\\65") omits the
leading zero, but fixed width is what keeps "\\nnn" unambiguous when it's
immediately followed by more digits (a variable-width "\\65" followed by a
literal "12" would be indistinguishable from "\\6" + "512" or "\\651" +
"2").

`decode_trigraphs()`'s optional `restrict_literals` flag adds a further,
separate check: real FOCAL has no true lowercase letters above 'e'
(0x66-0x7A are reassigned to unrelated symbols, not lowercase f-z) --
confirmed 2026-09-02 after a user-typed alarm message containing plain
lowercase ("Test Message") displayed as garbage on real DM41L hardware.
xm_file.py's NAME_MIN_CHAR/NAME_MAX_CHAR already enforced the same
0x20-0x65 boundary for XM file names (issue #11); `restrict_literals`
brings that same boundary to any other *content* a user types expecting
it to render as itself, without losing the ability to deliberately reach
any other byte value via an explicit trigraph escape.
