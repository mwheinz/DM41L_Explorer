'''
Byte-level parsing/encoding of the HP-41 "global chain" marker format
(docs/program.md sec 5.1/5.2), operating directly on a plain `bytes` buffer
rather than register-addressed `Memory` state.

`Memory._decode_chain_marker()`/`_decode_label_name()` (memory.py) do the
same decoding, but only against live registers via `Memory._addr_for()`/
`_pos_for()`. `Memory.import_program()` needs the same decoding applied to a
standalone RAW/DAT-decoded instruction-byte blob (program_files.py) *before*
it's spliced into program memory at all -- there's no register addressing
to lean on yet at that point, just the bytes themselves.

Marker format (docs/program.md sec 5.1/5.2), 3 bytes, in on-calculator
forward reading order (data[index] is the highest-address/first-read byte):

    byte 0: 1100 bbb d   (top nibble 0xC; bbb is 3 bits; d is the 9th/top
                           bit of distance_registers)
    byte 1: dddddddd     (the low 8 bits of distance_registers)
    byte 2: either `eeee ffff` (plain END: eeee=0 normal/2=.END., ffff=
             packed-status) or `F` + (name length + 1) for a global label

byte 0/1 together encode `distance_registers`/`bbb`; byte 2 ("third_byte"
here) means something different depending on whether this marker is a
label or not, and is never touched by import_program()'s own splicing
logic except to flip a `.END.`-turned-real-`END`'s high nibble -- see
Memory.import_program().

def walk_chain(data: bytes) -> list:
    '''
    Walks `data`'s own internal global chain backward, starting from its
    trailing 3-byte marker (`data[-3:]` -- every well-formed single-program
    byte blob, per `Memory.get_program_bytes()`/`decode_program_raw()`/
    `decode_program_dat()`, ends in one), and following each marker's own
    `bbb`/`distance_registers` field exactly as `Memory.list_global_chain()`
    does against live registers -- except entirely within `data`'s own
    bounds, using byte index instead of absolute address (index increases
    in the same forward-reading direction `Memory._read_bytes_forward()`
    uses, i.e. toward the *end* of `data`).

    Returns a list of dicts (each `decode_chain_marker()`'s own dict, plus
    `"index"`, and for a label also `"name"`/`"key_assignment"`), ordered
    newest-to-oldest: `result[0]` is always the trailing marker itself,
    and `result[-1]` is the *outermost* one -- the marker whose own
    distance field pointed *outside* `data` (or reported no predecessor at
    all, i.e. `bbb == distance_registers == 0`) in `data`'s original
    source memory. `Memory.import_program()` is the only caller that needs
    this: `result[-1]` is exactly the marker whose distance field has to
    be recomputed to link into the *destination* memory instead (every
    other entry's distance is an internal, position-independent
    relationship between two markers both inside `data`, and stays valid
    as-is when `data` is copied verbatim).

    Never raises -- stops (silently, the same defensive posture as
    `list_global_chain()`) if a computed target lands out of `data`'s own
    bounds (this is the normal/expected way the walk ends, not an error),
    if a target lands in-bounds but doesn't decode to a valid marker
    (shouldn't happen for well-formed HP-41 code; treated as if the
    current entry were outermost rather than raising, in case of a
    slightly-off fixture), or after a generous iteration cap as a
    backstop against a corrupt circular chain.
