"""
Regression test for gui/alarms_tab.py's edit-save path
(_save_new_or_edited_alarm()) -- user-reported 2026-09-02: entering an
invalid message while editing an alarm ("added an invalid character")
left the Alarms tab's list uneditable/unselectable for that alarm and
every alarm after it in the list.

Root cause: editing is implemented as delete_alarm(old) then
add_alarm(new) (see gui/alarms_tab.py's own docstring). When the
add_alarm() half raised (a bad trigraph, an over-length message, ...),
the except handler showed an error and returned WITHOUT re-rendering.
The old alarm was already gone from Memory (delete_alarm() closes the
gap, shifting every later alarm's start_addr down), but the Treeview
still held its pre-edit rows under their now-stale start_addr-as-iid
values -- so selecting the edited row (or anything after it) looked up
an address that either didn't exist anymore or now belonged to a
different alarm.

Requires a real Tk display (Xvfb in CI/sandboxes) -- same requirement as
test_xm_import_export.py/test_app.py.
